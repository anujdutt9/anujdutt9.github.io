**Hello Everyone !!**
Thanks for continuing with this post.

In the last post, we discussed about the use of Gradient Descent for Linear Regression, the theory and the mathematics behind it.

In this post, we will start writing the code for everything that we have learnt so far. So, let's get started.

You can find the Python code file and the IPython notebook for this tutorial [here](https://github.com/anujdutt9/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Linear%20Regression).

Great work on completing this tutorial, let's move to the next tutorial in series, [Introduction to Machine Learning: Linear Regression Code from Scratch]().

**For more projects and code, follow me on [Github](https://github.com/anujdutt9).**

**Please feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, corrections if any, below.**
