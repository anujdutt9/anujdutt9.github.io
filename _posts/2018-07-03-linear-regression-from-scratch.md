**Hello Everyone !!**
Thanks for continuing with this post.

In the last post, we discussed about the use of Gradient Descent for Linear Regression, the theory and the mathematics behind it.

In this post, we will start writing the code for everything that we have learnt so far. So, let's get started.

You can find the Python code file and the IPython notebook for this tutorial [here](https://github.com/anujdutt9/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Linear%20Regression).

## Linear Regression Code from Scratch

In this tutorial, we will be writing the code from scratch for Linear Regression
using the First Approach that we studied i.e. using the R-Squared Error and then
we will move on to plotting the "Best Fit Line" using Gradient Descent.
So, let's get started.

### Step-1: Import the Dependencies.
Mean: to calculate the mean of the data points

Numpy: for numerical calculations

Matplotlib: to plot the data

Pandas: to load the data and modify it 

**In [1]:**

```python
# Import Dependencies
from statistics import mean
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
 
We discussed in the starting tutorials that a straight line is represented by
the equation:
##### y = mx + b
where,
#### m: Slope of the line
#### b: bias


### Step2: Fit a line to Input Data

Also, we studied that to find out the "Best Fit Line" we require the values of m
and b. So, to find the best fit line, we used the formula:

#### Slope(m) = $\huge{\frac{(\overline{x} \times \overline{y}) - (\overline{x \times y})} {\overline{x}^2 - \overline{x^2}}}$

where,

$\overline{x}$: mean of x

$\overline{y}$: mean of y

$\overline{x}^2$: square of mean of x

$\overline{x^2}$: mean of square of x

#### Bias(b) = $\overline{y} - m \times \overline{x}$

where,

$\overline{y}$: mean of y

m: Slope

$\overline{x}$: mean of x

and then put these values in the equation of a straight line to get the new
values for y or what we called in the tutorial as y_hat. 

**In [2]:**

```python
# Equation for a Straight Line:  y = mx + b
# Function to predict the Best Fit Slope
# Slope(m) = (mean(x)*mean(y) - mean(x*y))/(mean(x)^2 - mean(x^2))
# Bias(b) = mean(y) - m*mean(x)

def best_fit_slope(X,y):
    slope_m = ((mean(X)*mean(y)) - mean(X*y))/(mean(X)**2 - mean(X**2))
    bias_b = mean(y) - slope_m*mean(X)
    return slope_m, bias_b
```
 
In the above function, we have calculated the hard coded values for slope(m) and
the bias(b). Now, let's input our data and see how this function performs to
form a "Best Fit Line".


### Step-3: Load Dataset
For this code, we will be taking the "Swedish Insurance Dataset". This is a very
simple dataset to start with and involves predicting the total payment for all
the claims in thousands of Swedish Kronor (y) given the total number of claims
(X). This means that for a new number of claims (X) we will be able to predict
the total payment of claims (y).

Let's load our data and have a look at it. 

**In [4]:**

```python
# Load the data using Pandas

df = pd.read_csv('dataset/Insurance-dataset.csv')
```

**In [5]:**

```python
# Let's have a look at the data, what it looks like, how many data points are there in the data.

print(df.head())
```

         X      Y
    0  108  392.5
    1   19   46.2
    2   13   15.7
    3  124  422.2
    4   40  119.4

 
Data is in the form of two columns, X and Y. X is the total number of claims and
Y represents the claims in thousands of Swedish Kronor.

Now, let's describe our data. 

**In [6]:**

```python
df.describe()
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>X</th>
      <th>Y</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>count</th>
      <td>63.000000</td>
      <td>63.000000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>mean</th>
      <td>22.904762</td>
      <td>98.187302</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>std</th>
      <td>23.351946</td>
      <td>87.327553</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>min</th>
      <td>0.000000</td>
      <td>0.000000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>25%</th>
      <td>7.500000</td>
      <td>38.850000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>50%</th>
      <td>14.000000</td>
      <td>73.400000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>75%</th>
      <td>29.000000</td>
      <td>140.000000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>max</th>
      <td>124.000000</td>
      <td>422.200000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>


 
So, both the columns have equal number of data points. Hence, the dataset is
stable. No need to modify the data. We also get the mean, max values in both
columns etc.

Now, let's put the data in the form to be input to the function we just defined
above. 

**In [7]:**

```python
# Load the data in the form to be input to the function for Best Fit Line

X = np.array(df['X'], dtype=np.float64)
y = np.array(df['Y'], dtype=np.float64)
```
 
### Step-4: Scatter Plot of Input Data
Before going any further, let's first plot our data and see if it's linear or
not. Remember, we require linear data to plot a best fit line and neglect the
Outliers.
So, let's plot the data. 

**In [8]:**

```python
# Scatter Plot of the Input Data

fig,ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(X,y)
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
ax.set_title('Input Data Scatter Plot')
```
 
![ScatterPlot](/assets/images/posts/2018/Linear_Regression/LinearRegression_12_1.png) 

 
From the above plot, we can see that the data is pretty linear except for 1 or 2
points. But that's ok. We can work with that.

Now, lets use the function we defined above and find the values for m and b to
get the line that best fits the data. 

**In [9]:**

```python
m,b = best_fit_slope(X,y)

print('Slope: ',m)
print('Bias: ',b)
```

    Slope:  3.41382356007
    Bias:  19.9944857591

 
### Step-5: Calculate Values of y_hat
Using these values of m and b, we can now find out the values of y which we call
as y_hat and when we plot them with X, we get our line. 

**In [10]:**

```python
# Calculate y_hat

y_hat = m*X + b

print('y_hat: ', y_hat)
```

    y_hat:  [ 388.68743025   84.8571334    64.37419204  443.30860721  156.54742816

       67.7880156   200.92713444  108.75389832]

 
### Step-6: Plot Line of Best Fit
Now, we have got the values for y_hat, m and b. Now, we can go ahead and plot
the line that fits the data. 

**In [11]:**

```python
# Scatter Plot of the Input Data with the line fit on Input Data

fig,ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(X,y)
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
ax.plot(X,y_hat)
ax.set_title('Line fit to Input Data')
```
 
![LineofBestFit](/assets/images/posts/2018/Linear_Regression/LinearRegression_18_1.png) 

 
### Step-7: Find the Squared Error and R-Squared Error

So, in the above plot we get the plot of the line fit to input data points. But
is this line really a good fit line ??

Now, we will write a function to check the accuracy of this line and see how
really best fit is this line.

So, how to proceed from here. Remember, we talked about the Square Error and the
R-Squared Error equations which help to provide the accuracy for the so called
best fit line. Let's implement these functions.

So, what is the equation for Squared Error?

### Squared Error = $\sum{(\texttt{y\_hat} - y)^2}$

Let's implement this. 

**In [12]:**

```python
# Squared Error
# Squared Error = sum((y_hat-y)^2)
def squared_Error(y, y_hat):
    return sum((y_hat - y)**2)
```
 
Now, we have our squared error. Next we want to calculate the R-Squared Error
using Squared Error function. So, what was the formula for this.

### R-Squared Error  =  1 - ((Squared_Error(y_hat)) / (Squared_Error(mean(y))))

So, let's implement it. 

**In [13]:**

```python
# R-Squared Error
def r_squared(y,y_hat):
    # Mean of all data points forms the mean line
    mean_line = mean(y)
    
    # Squared Error between Regression Line (y_hat) and the data points
    y_hat_Squared_Error = squared_Error(y,y_hat)
    
    # Squared Error between Mean Line and data points
    y_Squared_Error = squared_Error(y,mean_line)
    
    return 1 - (y_hat_Squared_Error/y_Squared_Error)
```
 
So, now since we have implemented both the functions, it's time to evaluate our
results. Let's see how accuate our current line is. 

**In [14]:**

```python
print('R-Squared Error: ', r_squared(y,y_hat))
```
    R-Squared Error:  0.833346671979
 
So, the R-Squared error is 0.833. But wait a minute. In the tutorial we
explained that R-Squared Error is actually the accuracy of the line. So what is
our error ?? 

**In [15]:**

```python
# Error%
error = 1 - r_squared(y,y_hat)
print('Error% : ', error*100)
```
    Error% :  16.6653328021

**In [16]:**

```python
# Accuracy%
print('Accuracy% : ', r_squared(y,y_hat))
```
    Accuracy% :  0.833346671979

So, our line is 83.33% accurate, which is pretty great but we would still like
to improve the accuracy.

But before that, let's take a random input "X" and see if we can get a value of
"y" accurately. 

**In [17]:**

```python
# Testing the Best Fit Line for Linear Regression
new_X = 85
new_y = (m*new_X + b)
print('y: ',new_y)
```
    y:  310.169488365

**In [24]:**

```python
# Let's now plot this point and check for accuracy
# Scatter Plot of the values "new_X" and "new_y"

fig,ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(X,y)
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
ax.scatter(new_X,new_y,c='r',s=100)
ax.plot(X,y_hat)
ax.set_title('Testing Line for New Data')
```
 
![BestFitLine](/assets/images/posts/2018/Linear_Regression/LinearRegression_30_1.png) 

 
The above plot shows that, for new data points i.e. new values of "X", this plot
can accurately predict the values of "y".
